# Cybersecurity-Conduct-a-security-audit
We will conduct an internal security audit of a small toy company, Botium Toys, to assess how they monitor and prepare for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect their continuity and critical assets. Concluding this, we will (in line with the company's goals) communicate the security audit results and recommendations to stakeholders.
